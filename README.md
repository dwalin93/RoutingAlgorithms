# Evaluating Routing-algorithm Approaches for Pedestrian Behaviour Simulation

###### Created by Katarzyna Goch, Maicol Camargo, Mutaz Qafisheh, Somnath Chaudhuri and Philipp Glahe

This repository includes the algorithms and results of the study project "Evaluating Routing-algorithm Approaches for Pedestrian Behaviour Simulation". 

The aim of this project was to understand how pedestrians formulate routes in a familiar urban environment. Furthermore, the main objective was to evaluate routing algorithms of pedestrian behavior by comparing computed
routes with observed routes. 

## Installation

To run the scripts, you need the to install following library (using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)):

- [networkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx)

## Scripts
The repository includes two main scripts:
- [Dijkstra.py](https://github.com/dwalin93/RoutingAlgorithms/blob/dev/Dijkstra.py)
- [A_Star_1.py](https://github.com/dwalin93/RoutingAlgorithms/blob/dev/A_Star_1.py)
